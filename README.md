# Smart Aquarium Care System

## Overview

This innovative device is designed to autonomously manage aquarium upkeep, eliminating the need for constant human intervention. It ensures precise fish feeding based on predetermined quantities and intervals set by the owner, while also checking the precise temperature for the fish using the DHT11 temperature sensor. Additionally, users will be notified of low food levels and out-of-range temperatures via SMS messages. Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD Display, DHT11 Temperature Sensor, Servo Motor, and GSM 800L module were used to develop this device. 

The LCD display shows elapsed time since the last feeding cycle, enabling the owner to manually feed the fish if necessary, adjusting based on the displayed time. Moreover, it includes alerts for unfavourable temperature ranges and notifies users when food supplies are low, enhancing fish care and ensuring a conducive environment for aquatic life.

Developed with the support of repaired components and external resources, this system promotes hassle-free aquarium maintenance, catering to both the fish's well-being and the owner's convenience.
