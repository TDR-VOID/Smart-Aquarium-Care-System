# Smart-Aquarium-Care-System
This innovative device is designed to autonomously manage aquarium upkeep, eliminating the need for constant human intervention. It ensures precise fish feeding based on predetermined quantities and intervals set by the owner. Using an Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD Display, DHT11 Temperature Sensor, Servo Motor, and GSM 800L module, this system allows customization of feeding schedules and fish quantities.

The LCD display shows elapsed time since the last feeding cycle, empowering the owner to manually feed the fish if necessary, adjusting based on the displayed time. Moreover, it includes alerts for unfavorable temperature ranges and notifies the user when food supplies are low, enhancing fish care and ensuring a conducive environment for aquatic life.

Developed with the support of repaired components and external resources, this system promotes hassle-free aquarium maintenance, catering to both the well-being of the fish and the convenience of the owner.
